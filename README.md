ScoutKit
========

A push button, client-server, event based FRC scouting system.

Set-Up + Install
================

Dependencies
------------

* Multiple laptops (6-7, one per robot being scouted and one head scouter) and a wired switch. (WiFi is frowned upon at pretty much all FRC competions)
* You, and 6 other ~~victims~~ volunteer scouters to operate the laptops. (1 head scouter to manage database, and 1 per robot).
* A reasonable knowledge of how to use Java and the command prompt. (Highly recommendend until I get around to nicely packaging it, still a good thing to have anyways)
* Runs on Java. JRE needed to run, JDK needed to compile.
* Requires installation of derby. See [the derby tutorial](https://db.apache.org/derby/papers/DerbyTut/install_software.html) for more info.
